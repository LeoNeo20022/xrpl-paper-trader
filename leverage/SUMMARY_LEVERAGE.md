## Separate line: LEVERAGED XRP grid, paper perpetual futures (`lev_2x`, `lev_5x`, PAPER-NOT-REAL)

Modelled on Binance USDⓈ-M XRPUSDT perps, isolated margin. Started **2026-10-26T15:45:00+00:00** at **$1.3024**, $100 paper each, not in the $300 total. Scoreboard: USD vs keep $100 in XRP bought at the same start. Last update 2026-10-29T17:57:28+00:00 at $1.2901 (prices: `binance_spot_data_api`, funding: `okx_proxy`).

| Line | **Value (USD, if closed now)** | Change vs $100 | **vs keep $100 in XRP** | Position XRP (avg entry) | Liquidation price | Open levels | Round trips | Fees paid (trading + funding) | **Liquidations (margin lost)** | Max drawdown |

- Rules: 10 buy levels 2% apart below the start, $10 margin each (2x = $20 of XRP, 5x = $50), take profit +2% per level, profit kept in USDT, static ladder. Costs: 0.02% maker per fill, 8-hourly funding, and the value assumes a market close (0.05% taker + 0.05% slippage). Liquidation when margin + unrealised P/L falls to 0.5% of the position; the whole margin is lost. Backtest: `leverage/backtest_leverage_output.txt`.

## Candidate live setup (PAPER-NOT-REAL): $1,000 on Kraken US XRP perpetual PXRPUH, committee 'get on base' line, 2x and 3x caps

Same committee signals/rules as `com_xrp_5x_quick` (take profit +1.5% underlying, stop the tighter of 1% or 1.5x ATR), whole 500-XRP contracts only, Kraken fees $0.0113/contract/side + 0.05% slippage on market fills, funding stand-in (`okx_proxy`), liquidation at 17% maintenance margin + $10 fee. Last update 2026-10-29T17:57:37+00:00 at $1.2901. Target: $4/day after fees.

| Line | Started | **P/L after fees + funding** | **$/day vs $4 target** | Worst drawdown | Trades (win rate) | Longs: closed (wins) P/L | Shorts: closed (wins) P/L | Contracts held now | Fees / funding | Liquidations | vs hold $1,000 XRP |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `com_xrp_kraken_1k_2x` (2x cap) | 2026-10-26T18:15:00+00:00 | **-20.42** | **-6.84** (-10.84 vs $4) | -25.60 (2.5%) | 1 (0%) | 0 | 1 (0% wins) -20.42 | 0 (FLAT) | $0.07 / $-0.20 | 0 | -12.46 |
| `com_xrp_kraken_1k_3x` (3x cap) | 2026-10-26T18:15:00+00:00 | **-27.23** | **-9.11** (-13.11 vs $4) | -34.14 (3.4%) | 1 (0%) | 0 | 1 (0% wins) -27.23 | 0 (FLAT) | $0.09 / $-0.26 | 0 | -19.27 |

- $/day is P/L since start divided by days running; tiny in the first days. Backtest: `leverage/backtest_contracts_1k_output.txt`. Kraken's PXRPUH initial margin is unverified (3x assumed safer than 5x).
