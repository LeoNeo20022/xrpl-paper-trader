<!-- COMMITTEE-BEGIN -->
## Separate lines: COMMITTEE, paper perps on XRP and BTC (`com_*` rule-based, `com_*_proxy_*` team proxies; PAPER-NOT-REAL)

Rule-based: long scout, short scout, idle guard, chart reader, with crowding, Fear & Greed and Theo's rules R1-R6 (toggleable). Proxy lines: automated Casey/Pip/Theo/Remy following each teammate's spec. Votes every 15 min; 3 of 4 must agree to open; a 2-2 LONG/SHORT split is a tie (stay flat, logged to `leverage/logs/committee_ties.csv` with shadow outcomes). Every line runs at $100 plus $50 and $500 twins (`_50`, `_500`), isolated margin; `com_*_5x_quick` = 'get on base' 5x: take profit at +1.5% underlying (about +7.5% on margin; +1.5% backtested better than +1%, see `leverage/backtest_sizes_output.txt`), stop the tighter of 1% or 1.5x ATR; same costs/funding/liquidation as leverage_ta.

### $50 / $100 / $500 side by side (profit after fees + funding; worst drawdown = biggest drop from a high; max loss = lowest value vs start)
