# XRP/RLUSD paper-trading experiment: SUMMARY

> **PAPER ONLY.** Simulated trades from public prices. No wallet, no keys, no real orders. Not financial or tax advice.

**Scoreboard: value in RLUSD/USD**, XRP-equivalent second. Each strategy has its own **$100** (paper total **$300**) and is compared with **keep $100 in XRP** (bought at the start).

_History replayed on 2026-10-24 from Bitstamp 5-min candles after bad XRPL book data was removed, then re-sized to $100 per strategy (earlier versions archived under `*/archive_phantom_2026-10-24/` and `*/archive_resize_2026-10-24/`)._

**Experiment ($300) vs keep $300 in XRP: +26.01 USD (+10.61%)** · XRP-equivalent: +10.61%

\* Value = XRP held × current mid + RLUSD. XRP-equivalent = XRP held + RLUSD converted at the current mid with a 0.05% taker cost. XRP held includes the XRP locked as ledger reserve (it is still yours).

**All values and P/L are after fees.** Fees paid = taker/AMM cost on market buys + XRPL network fee on every transaction, as if each were a plain OfferCreate/OfferCancel/TrustSet/AMMDeposit signed in Xaman. Network fee this tick: 0.000020 XRP per tx = max(0.00002, live open-ledger fee 1e-05) capped at 0.01. Grid limit orders fill at their limit price (maker, no AMM fee). Before Oct 24 fills paid 0.00001 XRP; the TrustSet and initial-ladder OfferCreates were charged once on Oct 24 (catch-up), dip-ladder refresh cancels/creates from then on. Reserve locked = 1 XRP base + 0.2 per trust line/offer, held by the ledger (not spent). **Not included:** Xaman's own 0.8% service fee on swaps, AMM deposits/withdrawals and DEX trades (see README).

- `dip_ladder` is an **XRP-accumulation** strategy (it only buys and never sells), so it only grows dollar value if XRP rises.
- `scalp_2pct_rlusd` runs the same 2% grid as `scalp_2pct` but banks each round trip's whole profit in RLUSD and does not recompound it.

- Dip ladder open buy orders: none (reference 1.08488, next refresh 2026-11-17T08:45:00+00:00)
- `scalp_2pct`: 0 buy orders waiting, 10 sell orders waiting, XRP kept from scalps 1.24859
- `scalp_2pct_rlusd`: 0 buy orders waiting, 10 sell orders waiting, XRP kept from scalps 0.0

## Separate line: XRP stacker, 4% steps (`xrp_stacker`, PAPER-NOT-ON-LEDGER) — scoreboard is XRP COUNT

XRP stacker: sell slices high, buy back lower with all the RLUSD (goal: more XRP). Separate $100 line, not included in the $300 total. Started 2026-10-20T08:43:56+00:00 at $1.2948 with **77.1917 XRP** (= keep $100 in XRP).

| | **XRP held** | vs start XRP | RLUSD parked (waiting to rebuy) | XRP-equivalent* | Value (RLUSD/USD) | vs keep $100 in XRP (USD) | Round trips | XRP gained from trips | Forced rebuys (XRP lost) | Fees paid USD (network XRP) | Reserve locked XRP |

| Baseline: keep $100 in XRP | 77.1917 | +0.0000 | $0.00 | 77.1917 | $81.69 | — | | | | | |

- Rules: 4 sell slices of 15% of the sellable stack at +4% steps above the reference; each sold slice rebuys with ALL its RLUSD one step (4%) lower, so each round trip ends with more XRP. No RLUSD profit is banked. Cost 0.25% per fill (AMM 0.205% + slippage) + network fee. Ladder trails down when nothing is parked and price is 4% below the reference. A slice parked over 14 days is bought back at market (can lose XRP).
- Orders now (reference 1.03015): rebuy 1.0301 sell 1.1142 sell 1.1588 sell 1.2051
- Risk: in a sustained rally the RLUSD stays parked or is rebought higher, so it ends with **fewer XRP than just holding**.

## Separate line: XRP stacker, 6% steps (`xrp_stacker_6pct`, PAPER-NOT-ON-LEDGER) — scoreboard is XRP COUNT

XRP stacker 6% steps (side-by-side test): sell slices high, buy back 6% lower with all the RLUSD (goal: more XRP). Separate $100 line, not included in the $300 total. Started 2026-10-20T08:43:56+00:00 at $1.2948 with **77.1917 XRP** (= keep $100 in XRP).

Costs: 0.02% maker per fill, 8-hourly funding, and the value assumes a market close (0.05% taker + 0.05% slippage). Liquidation when margin + unrealised P/L falls to 0.5% of the position; the whole margin is lost. Backtest: `leverage/backtest_leverage_output.txt`.

## Candidate live setup (PAPER-NOT-REAL): $1,000 on Kraken US XRP perpetual PXRPUH, committee 'get on base' line, 2x and 3x caps

Same committee signals/rules as `com_xrp_5x_quick` (take profit +1.5% underlying, stop the tighter of 1% or 1.5x ATR), whole 500-XRP contracts only, Kraken fees $0.0113/contract/side + 0.05% slippage on market fills, funding stand-in (`okx_proxy`), liquidation at 17% maintenance margin + $10 fee. Last update 2026-11-11T04:05:15+00:00 at $1.0591. Target: $4/day after fees.

| Line | Started | **P/L after fees + funding** | **$/day vs $4 target** | Worst drawdown | Trades (win rate) | Longs: closed (wins) P/L | Shorts: closed (wins) P/L | Contracts held now | Fees / funding | Liquidations | vs hold $1,000 XRP |

- $/day is P/L since start divided by days running; tiny in the first days. Backtest: `leverage/backtest_contracts_1k_output.txt`. Kraken's PXRPUH initial margin is unverified (3x assumed safer than 5x).

## Every XRPL line at $100 vs $500 (PAPER; $100 is what actually ran, $500 is scaled)

$500 = the $100 result x5 minus extra price impact for 5x larger orders, using live XRP/RLUSD AMM depth (pool 2,008,270 XRP / 2,127,580 RLUSD from https://xrplcluster.com). Worst drawdown = biggest drop from a high point in the line's history. Profit is after fees.
